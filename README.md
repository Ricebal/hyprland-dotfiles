# Rice's Hyprland Dotfiles
My dotfiles for wayland compositor hyprland. Tested on Fedora and Arch linux.

## Dependencies
This config requires some packages to be installed.

### Required
```
hyprland hyprlock hyprpaper wlogout kitty waybar wofi python-pywal
```

### Optional
```
visual-studio-code neovim ranger imv dolphin
```

## Extra information
Runs host specific configuration by having directories based on host name.
Might not work if pywal hasn't been run at least once.
